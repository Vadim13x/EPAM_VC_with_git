Yeah, You never said a word 
You didn`t send me no letter 
Don`t think I could forgive you 
See our world is slowly dying 
I`m not wasting no more time 
Don`t think I could believe you 

Yeah, You never said a word 
You didn`t send me no letter 
Don`t think I could forgive you 
See our world is slowly dying 
I`m not wasting no more time 
Don`t think I could believe you 

Yeah, our hands will get more wrinkled
And our hair will be grey 
Don`t think I could forgive you 
And see the children are starving 
And their houses were destroyed 
Don`t think they could forgive you
